summary: "This includes the notes related to differential equation. A differential equation of simple form 洧녬洧녽/洧녬洧노 + 洧녞 (洧노)洧녽 = 洧녭(洧노) explains how the change in one variable (independent variable) affects the other dependent variable. Differential equation helps to explain how the systems changes over time."
